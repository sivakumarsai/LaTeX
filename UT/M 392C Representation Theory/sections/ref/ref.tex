\subsection*{\hspace{1em}Basic Lie theory}
 R.~Carter, G.~Segal and I.MacDonald: Lectures on Lie Groups and Lie Algebras. London Math. Society Student Texts 32. The lectures by Segal are a beautiful overview of the fundamental ideas of Lie groups and algebras, with geometry and examples emphasized.

W.~Fulton and J.~Harris: Representation Theory. Springer GTM 129. The canonical reference for representations, especially for the (Lie) algebraic point of view and basic algebro--geometric aspects.

\subsection*{\hspace{1em}Review articles}
G.~Mackey: Harmonic Analysis as the Exploitation of Symmetry. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 3/1 (1980) 543-699. Reprinted in: The Scope and History of Commutative and Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis. History of Math Vol.5, Amer. Math Soc./London Math Soc. 1992. My favorite (and first) introduction to representation theory, emphasizing its history and origins in probability, number theory and physics. The reprint appears in a volume devoted to Mackey's wonderful representation theory survey articles.

Other Mackey surveys (besides those in the book above): Unitary Group Representations in physics, probability and number theory (Addison-Wesley 1989) -- a book delving deeper into the ideas of the above survey article.

W.~Schmid: Representations of semi-simple Lie groups. In: Atiyah et al., Representation Theory of Lie Groups. Londom Math Society Lecture Notes 34. Cambridge U. Press 1979. Excellent overview by a master, in a volume full of useful reviews (also Mackey, Bott, Kostant, Kazhdan..)

W.~Schmid: Analytic and Geometric Realization of Representations. In: Tirao and Wallach (eds)., New Developments in Lie Theory and their Applications. Lecture notes overviewing the subject in the title, with a strong emphasis on $\SL_2$.
