\noindent\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Goals}}

Seeking to obtain a B.Sc. in mathematics.%, then to earn a Ph.D in mathematics; I do not know which specialization it would be in.

\noindent\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Education}}

\textsl{July 2020 - present:} B.Sc. in Mathematics with a 3.98 GPA currently, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. To graduate May 2024.

\textsl{August 2016 - June 2020:} Graduated with IB diploma with a 4.0 GPA, Stanton College Preparatory High School, Jacksonville, Florida.

%\noindent\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Research}}

%[none]

\noindent\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Talks and Presentations}}

\textsl{February - March 2022:} To be expected. Will give a series of lectures/talks which briefly outline Fourier analysis on finitely generated abelian groups with some neat results, as they appear in Stein and Shakarchi I.

\textsl{October 2021:} A classmate and I discussed the real Hamilton quaternions, their history as well as their algebraic properties, and mentioned analytic problems with functions of quaternionic variables. Also spoke about applications in computer science and physics.

\textsl{October 2021:} Gave the annual \LaTeX\hspace{1pt} joint seminar with the UF Graduate Mathematics Association. This seminar is designed to demonstrate how \LaTeX\hspace{1pt} works and what it can do, and to encourage mathematics students to learn \LaTeX\hspace{1pt}.

\textsl{June 2021:} Discussed the integral definition of the inverse Laplace transform, as well as how to compute the integral using the residue theorem, at an elementary level. ({\color{blue}\href{https://youtu.be/20Xbrit2chw}{YouTube}})

\textsl{March 2021:} Gave a talk on proving the fundamental theorem of calculus at a highschool/pre-real analysis level. ({\color{blue}\href{https://youtu.be/l4GO-n-2ETQ}{YouTube}})

%\noindent\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Experience}}

\noindent\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Skills}}

3+ years of \LaTeX\hspace{1pt} experience (high proficiency).

Proficiency in Java, C\verb!++!, and understanding of data structures and algorithms.

\textsl{September 2021 - present:} Member of the Algebra seminar group.

\textsl{August 2021 - present:} Teaching assistant for \textsl{MAP2302} Elementary Differential Equations.

\textsl{August 2021 - present:} Member of the Association for Women in Mathematics' UF chapter.

\textsl{August 2021 - present:} Academic Director of the University Math Society at UF. I schedule all talks from professors and give talks myself, as well as encouraging other students to give talks as well.

\textsl{March 2021 - present:} Moderator for a large online community (exceeding 75,000 members globally) which seeks to stimulate mathematical discussion and interest, as well as to provide assistance with math problems/concepts.

\textsl{August 2020 - December 2020:} Typed up many solutions for \textsl{Concepts in Calculus
III} by Miklos Bona and Sergei Shabanov (around 47 pages or so, working with two others to form in total 141 pages of solutions compiled in a solution manual).

\textsl{August 2019 - February 2020:} Started a small unofficial mathematics club (in highschool) where students presented on topics of mathematical interest; there I gave three informal talks.
