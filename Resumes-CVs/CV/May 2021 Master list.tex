\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Goals}}

Pursuing a B.Sc. in mathematics. I intend to pursue graduate studies afterwards.

\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Education}}

\textsl{July 2020 - present:} B.Sc. in Mathematics with a 3.97 GPA currently, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. To graduate May 2024.

\textsl{August 2016 - June 2020:} Graduated with IB diploma with a 4.0 GPA, Stanton College Preparatory High School, Jacksonville, Florida.

\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Research}}

\textsl{June - July 2022:} REU at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Worked with Dr. Ashley Wheeler and two other undergraduates on a project in algebraic geometry. We studied the toric varieties given by the vanishing of principal $2$-minor ideals in affine and projective space. We proved a number of properties about these varieties, and created {\color{blue}\href{https://math.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/boniface-rodriguez-sivakumar-wheeler.pdf}{this poster}}.

\makebox[1.3cm][l]{\rule{1cm}{5pt}}{\textbf{Talks and Presentations}}

\textsl{October 2022:} Small talk motivating representations of groups as compared with group actions and briefly mentioned their applications in Fourier analysis. 

\textsl{February - March 2022:} Series of lectures/talks briefly outlining Fourier analysis on finitely generated Abelian groups with some neat results, as they appear in Stein and Shakarchi I. 

\textsl{October 2021:} A classmate and I discussed the real Hamilton quaternions, their history as well as their algebraic properties, and mentioned analytic problems with functions of quaternionic variables. Also spoke about applications in computer science and physics.

\textsl{October 2021, November 2022:} Gave the annual \LaTeX\hspace{1pt} joint seminar with the UF Graduate Mathematics Association. This seminar is designed to demonstrate how \LaTeX\hspace{1pt} works and what it can do, and to encourage mathematics students to learn \LaTeX\hspace{1pt}.

\textsl{June 2021:} Discussed the integral definition of the inverse Laplace transform, as well as how to compute the integral using the residue theorem, at an elementary level. ({\color{blue}\href{https://youtu.be/20Xbrit2chw}{YouTube}}) (Gave an abridged version of this talk January 2023.)

\textsl{March 2021:} Gave a talk on proving the fundamental theorem of calculus at a highschool/pre-real analysis level. ({\color{blue}\href{https://youtu.be/l4GO-n-2ETQ}{YouTube}})
