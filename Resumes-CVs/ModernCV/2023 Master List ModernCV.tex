\section{Research}
\cventry{Summer 2023}{REU at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities}{}{Two projects:}{}{\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1)] Worked with Dr. Christine Berkesch and four undergraduates on a project in algebraic geometry and homological algebra. We extended results in {\color{blue}\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02759}{previous work}} by Harada et al. to provide two methods for finding {\color{blue}\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07631}{virtual resolutions}} (Berkesch et al.) for ideals of sets of points in $\mathbb{P}^n\times \mathbb P^m$, and created {\color{blue}\href{https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/REU/REU2023notes/2_VResPointsReport.pdf}{this report}} (preprint in progress).
    \item[2)] Worked with Dr. Michael Perlman and four undergraduates on a project in commutative algebra, homological algebra, and representation theory. We studied $\GL_n(k)$-stable ideals of polynomial rings in positive characteristics and their free resolutions. We provide a method for finding minimal free resolutions for a wide class of $\GL_2(k)$-stable ideals generated in a single degree in any positive characteristic. We created {\color{blue}\href{https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~reiner/REU/REU2023notes/4_GL_stable_Ideals_in_Positive_Characteristic.pdf}{this report}} (preprint in progress).
\end{enumerate}}
\cventry{Summer 2022}{REU at the Georgia Institute of Technology}{}{}{}{Worked with Dr. Ashley Wheeler and two other undergraduates on a project in algebraic geometry. We studied the toric varieties given by the vanishing of principal $2$-minor ideals in affine and projective space. We proved a number of properties about these varieties, and created {\color{blue}\href{https://math.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/boniface-rodriguez-sivakumar-wheeler.pdf}{this poster}}.}
