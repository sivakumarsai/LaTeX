\begin{enumerate}
    \item (15.1.4) Prove that if $R$ is Noetherian, then so is the ring $R[[x]]$ of formal power series in the variable $x$ with coefficients from $R$ (cf. Exercise 3, Section 7.2). [Mimic the proof of Hilbert's Basis Theorem.] \begin{proof}
        
    \end{proof}
    \item (15.2.9) Prove that for any field $k$ the map $\mathcal{Z}$ in the Nullstellensatz is always surjective and the map $\mathcal{I}$ in the Nullstellensatz is always injective. [Use property (10) of the maps $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ in Section 1.] Give examples (over a field $k$ that is not algebraically closed) where $\mathcal{Z}$ is not injective and $\mathcal{I}$ is not surjective. \begin{proof}
    We have the equivalence $\mathcal{Z}(S) = \mathcal{Z}((S))$, where $(S)$ is the ideal generated by the elements of $S$. 

    The map $\mathcal{Z}$ taking radical ideals to affine algebraic sets is surjective: Given an affine algebraic set $V = \mathcal{Z}(S) = \mathcal{Z}((S))$, we have \[\id(\mathcal{Z}((S)))= \mathcal{Z}((S)) = \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{Z}((S))))\] using property (10) of the maps $\mathcal{Z},\mathcal{I}$ from Section 1. It follows that $\mathcal{Z}$ has a right inverse (here we have $\mathcal{I}$) and hence is surjective.
    
    The map $\mathcal{I}$ taking affine algebraic sets to radical ideals is injective: Let $V = \mathcal{Z}((S))$ and $W = \mathcal{Z}((T))$ and assume that $\mathcal{I}(V) = \mathcal{I}(W)$. Then \[V = \mathcal{Z}((S)) = \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{Z}((S)))) = \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{Z}((T)))) = \mathcal{Z}((T)) = W\] so that $\mathcal{I}$ is injective as needed. 
    \end{proof}

    When $k=\mathbb{R}$ the zero set of both $(1)$ and $(x^2+1)$ (note $(x^2+1)$ is prime so both $(1)$ and $(x^2+1)$ are radical ideals and are not equal to each other) in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ is the empty set, so $\mathcal{Z}$ is not injective as $\mathbb{R}$ is not algebraically closed.

    When $k = \mathbb{R}$ there is no algebraic set $V$ for which the ideal $ (x^2+1)$ is equal to $\mathcal{I}(V)$. If there was such a $V$, it must be a finite set or $\mathbb{R}$ itself. But $\mathcal{I}(\emptyset) = \mathbb{R}[x]$, $\mathcal{I}(\cbr{r_i}_{i=1}^n) = (\prod_{i=1}^n (x-r_i))$ and $\mathcal{I}(\mathbb{R}) = (0)$ (and note that these three ideals are indeed radical ideals). It follows that $(x^2+1)$ has no preimage under $\mathcal{I}$ since $\mathbb{R}$ is not algebraically closed.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    %\item (15.1.24)
    \item (15.1.28) Prove that if $V$ and $W$ are affine algebraic sets, then so is $V\times W$ and $k[V\times W]\cong k[V]\otimes_kk[W]$. \begin{proof}
        Let $V = \mathcal{Z}(S)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^n$ and $W = \mathcal{Z}(T)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^m$, where $S\subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $T\subseteq k[y_1,\dots,y_m]$. Then $V\times W \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n+m}$ is the vanishing set of $S\cup T$ where now we view $S,T\subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_m]$: Certainly for any $v\times w\in V\times W$ we have that for $f\in S\cup T$ $f(v\times w) = 0$ since $f$ is in one of $S$ or $T$ and $v\in V, w\in W$. Conversely, if $f(v\times w) = 0$ for all $f\in S\cup T$ then $v\in V$ and $w\in W$ since $f$ is in one of $S$ or $T$ and we may restrict evaluating $f$ at $v\times w$ to one of the factors of $v\times w$. If we take any $f\in S\subset S\cup T$, see that $f(v\times w) = f(v) = 0$ so that $v\in V$; similarly by taking any $f\in T\subset S\cup T$ find that $w\in W$. It follows that $V\times W = \mathcal{Z}(S\cup T)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n+m}$ where $S\cup T$ is viewed as a subset of $k[x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_m]$.

        We define the map $\Psi\colon k[V]\otimes_kk[W]\to k[V\times W]$ by defining it on generators. Specifically $k[V]$ and $k[W]$ are vector spaces with bases $\cbr{f_i}$ and $\cbr{g_j}$ respectively. It follows that $\cbr{f_i\otimes g_j}$ form a basis for $k[V]\otimes_kk[W]$. Let $\Psi(f_i\otimes g_j) = f_ig_j$ where the product on the right hand side means to multiply pointwise. Extend by linearity. It is also clear that this map respects the multiplication $(f\otimes g)(s\otimes t) = fs\otimes gt\mapsto fsgt$. Psi is also well defined since the product of any function with any function which is zero on $V$ or $W$ (i.e. zero on $V\times W$) is still zero.

        The mapping $\Psi$ is injective: if $\sum a_{ij}f_i\otimes g_j \mapsto \sum a_{ij}f_ig_j = 0$ then for all $v\in V$ we have $\sum a_{ij}f_i(v)g_j = 0$ on $W$. By linear independence we must have that $\sum a_{ij}f_i = 0$ on $V$ so that again by linear independence we must have $a_{ij} = 0$ for each $i,j$ as needed. The mapping $\Psi$ is surjective since any monomial in $k[V\times W]$ is the product of monomials in $k[V]$ and $k[W]$, of which we can form preimages of under $\Psi$: for any monomial $a\prod_ix_i\prod_jy_j$ a preimage is $a\prod_ix_i\otimes \prod_jy_j$ and by linearity we obtain surjectivity. Hence $\Psi\colon k[V]\otimes_kk[W]\to k[V\times W]$ is an isomorphism of algebras.
    \end{proof}
    \item (15.2.3) Prove that the intersection of two radical ideals is again a radical ideal. \begin{proof}
        For radical ideals $I,J$ of $R$ we have that the containment $I\cap J\subseteq \rad (I\cap J)$ always holds. Suppose that $r\in \rad(I\cap J)$ so that there is some power $r^k$ in both $I$ and $J$. But since $I$ and $J$ are radical it follows that $r$ is in $I$ and $J$ so that $r\in I\cap J$ also. In general we should have that $\rad I\cap \rad J = \rad (I\cap J)$ for ideals $I,J$ of $R$.
